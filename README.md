# Usage
## Basic Usage

Import the package:

```dart
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyHomePage({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Updater(
      countryCode: LanguageCodes.tr.name, // optional arg
      language: LanguageCodes.en, // optional arg
      // versionRequiredStatus: VersionRequiredStatus.require, // optional arg
      // title: const Text('Custom title'), // optional arg
      // content: const Text('Custom content'), // optional arg
      // onCloseTap: () => log('onCloseTap'), // optional arg
      // showVersions: false, // optional arg
      child: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('IUpdater'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
